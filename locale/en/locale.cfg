WindSpeedChanging-Tweaked-windSpeedMax=Sets the max allowed wind speed for a surface. The default factorio value is 0.02.
WindSpeedChanging-Tweaked-windSpeedMin=Sets the minimal wind speed for surfaces.
WindSpeedChanging-Tweaked-seasonShortest=Sets the shortest duration for a season in seconds.
WindSpeedChanging-Tweaked-seasonLongest=Sets the longest duration for a season in sceconds.
WindSpeedChanging-Tweaked-varySurfaceSpeeds=Vary the min and max surace speeds per surface.
WindSpeedChanging-Tweaked-varyCoefficient=Precentage by which min and max will be varied. So a setting of 0.25 means the max and min will be varied by up to 25% in either direction. A max of 1 could end up as 0.75 or 1.25.
